# Description

my current tf2 hud as of 18/01/23 based on dqz's version of m0rehud (now using m0rehud 7.1 as a base!)

also mostly a mishmash of various parts from huds i like

## Credits

Hypnotize - maintaining m0rehud + this sexy customization menu

dqz - original m0rehud edit this is based off of

CriticalFlaw - FlawHud Loadout Menus, Inventory & Win Panel.

Lead - InsomniaHud level tf_english edit

playmoo - bothud chat tf_english edit

xcd859 - "background_gravelpit" menu background

Niterux - "serenity" menu background from [here](https://github.com/Niterux/xhud)

and many more i don't recall, very appreciated

## Special Thanks

everyone in huds.tf discord for helping me with any issues i had while editing the hud

ps: i might be forgetful to update on comfig, so be sure to check out the actual repo to get the most up-to-date version

note: 99% of customizations are compatible, the only thing that might not be are the fonts, wich are different from m0rehud's.
